# 🎉 What's New in SaveTracker

## Analytics Now Opt-Out

We've changed our analytics system to be **opt-out by default** instead of opt-in. This helps us better understand how SaveTracker is being used and improve the application.

### What This Means

- **Anonymous analytics are now enabled by default**
- You can still disable analytics anytime in **Settings → Analytics**
- We collect **NO personal information** - only anonymous usage statistics

### What We Collect

✅ Anonymous device ID (SHA256 hash)  
✅ Game names (no paths or directories)  
✅ File counts (no file names or paths)  
✅ Play duration and timestamps

❌ NO usernames or personal information  
❌ NO file paths or file names  
❌ NO cloud provider details

### Your Privacy Matters

Your privacy is our top priority. All data is completely anonymous and helps us:
- Understand which features are most used
- Identify and fix bugs faster
- Make SaveTracker better for everyone

**You can disable analytics at any time** in Settings → Analytics tab.
