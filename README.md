## 🔥 Why SaveTracker?

### 🧠 **It Just Knows.**
Forget manual uploads. SaveTracker's **Smart Tracking Engine** detects when a game launches and watches the filesystem in real-time. The second you quit, your progress is safely in the cloud.

### 👤 **Multiple Profiles**
Share a PC? Experimenting with mods? Create unlimited **Save Profiles** for any game and switch between them instantly. Your original saves are always safe.

### ⚡ **Native Speed.**
Written in performance-obsessed **.NET 8 AOT**, SaveTracker starts instantly. With the new **Pre-Caching System**, browsing your library is instantaneous.

### 📦 **Smart Transfer (.STA)**
Say goodbye to cloud clutter. Our new **Smart Transfer Architect (.STA)** bundles small files together, making uploads **50% faster** and keeping your cloud storage organized.

### 🐧 **Partial Linux Support (Experimental)**
We love the Penguin!
- **Headless Power**: Run SaveTracker as a background daemon on your Linux rig or Steam Deck.
- **Process Monitoring**: Native tracking for Linux processes via `/proc`.

## 💎 Feature Highlights

- **Headless Mode**: A phantom process for tracking without a UI. Perfect for HTPCs and handhelds.
- **Smart Sync**: Uploads only what changed. Advanced checksumming saves your bandwidth.
- **IPC API**: Developers can hook into SaveTracker via simple JSON-RPC pipes.
- **Universal Launcher**: Works with everything. Yes, even that obscure indie game from 2005.
- **Migration Tool**: Seamlessly upgrade your legacy tracked games to the new system.
- **Privacy First**: No accounts, no servers, no tracking. Your data stays yours.
